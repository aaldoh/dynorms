Lots of the research that is shown is however, as far as my understanding goes, based on US data and does not account for the differences in UK climate. For example people state that eating vegan is better for water consumption, however this information comes from the US, where there is less rainfall and water is needed to be pumped to give to life stock, whereas this is not such the case in the UK. Similarly our crop processes and productions are different to the US, so water consumption for the food for livestock is also less that the media states. 

I think there are also health beliefs about eating less meat, though these are probably due to eating more vegetables, which is needed for a vegan/no meat meal! ",,2,3,5,4,3,3,4,6,3,3,3,30,3,8,3,5,3,28,2,2,1
