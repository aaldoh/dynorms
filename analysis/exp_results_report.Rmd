## Exploratory Analyses

### 3. Does dynamic norm (versus static or no norm) information increase participantsâ€™ positive attitude, intentions, and expectations to reduce their meat consumption?
    
```{r SEM, results="asis"}
h3.table %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Posterior results for simple model (H3)", escape = F) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Model 1: Uninformative priors" = 5, "Model 2: Informative priors" = 5, "Model 3: Informative priors" = 5)) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

### 4. How does age interact with norm condition to influence dependent variables? 
```{r Interaction, results="asis"}
interact.table %>% 
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Posterior results for multi-sample analysis by age (H4)", row.names = F, escape = F) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Model 1: Uninformative priors" = 5, "Model 2: Informative priors" = 5, "Model 3: Informative priors" = 5)) %>%  
  kable_styling() %>%
  pack_rows("Older", 1, 4) %>%
  pack_rows("Younger", 5, 8)
```

### 5. How do demographic factors such as age, gender, and political position predict primary dependent variables relating to meat consumption? 

```{r full SEM, results='asis'}
h5.table %>% 
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Posterior results for full model (H5)", row.names = F, escape = F) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Model 1: Uninformative priors" = 5, "Model 2: Informative priors" = 5, "Model 3: Informative priors" = 5)) %>%
  pack_rows("Interest", 1, 4) %>%
  pack_rows("Attitudes", 5, 8) %>%
  pack_rows("Intentions", 9, 12) %>%
  pack_rows("Expectations", 13, 16)
```
